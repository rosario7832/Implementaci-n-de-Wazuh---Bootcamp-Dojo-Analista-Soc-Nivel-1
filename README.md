5. **Access the Wazuh web interface:**
   - Once the VM is running, open your browser and navigate to:  
     ```

Once you log in to **Wazuh**, you will have access to multiple resources typical of a **SIEM** and will be able to view each connected agent, as shown in the following image.

To deploy an agent, it is recommended to consult the [official Wazuh documentation](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/deployment-options/index.html), as the procedure will depend on the device where it needs to be installed.
